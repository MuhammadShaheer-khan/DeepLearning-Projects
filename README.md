# DeepLearning-Projects

### Project One:
1- Binary Classification Sonar Project 1 for the Navy:
In this project you will discover how to effectively use the Keras library in your machine learning project by working through a binary classification project step-by-step.

### Project Two
2- Multi-Class Classification Iris Flowers Project 2 for Mothers who love Gardening and Flowers: 
Identifying Flower Types.
In this project, you will discover how you can use Keras to develop and evaluate neural network models for multi-class classification projects.

### Project Three
3- Regression Housing Pricing Project 3 for Fathers who want to buy a House: 
Predicting Housing Prices.
In this project you will discover how to develop and evaluate neural network models using Keras for a regression problem.
